*** Workshop goals
**** After this workshop, you should understand:
     - How to receive information from external controls;
     - How to apply external data to audio processes;
     - Basics of \egls{granular synthesis}.
     - Basic audio programming concepts, in SuperCollider.
**** At the end, we'll try to perform some music for computer ensemble!

*** Organization of the material
**** Three types of material in this workshop:
     - General :: Useful for all interactive hardware and software. \\
       Your main take-away!
     - OSC/SC :: Specific to Open Sound Control and SuperCollider. \\
       "Implementation details" change with the device and software.
     - Workshop :: The specific way of using OSC and SC for this workshop. \\
       Useful to play with, but don't limit yourself to them.
**** The /general/ principles are the most important to remember.
     You'll see them again and again, in every environment.

*** Overview
**** General outline:
     - Theoretical background.
     - Setup and usage of the SuperCollider environment.
     - Open Sound Control and SuperCollider communication.
     - Granular synthesis fundamentals.
     - Workshop performance interface.
     - Preparing materials for the final performance.

* Interactive audio technology
** Interactive audio technology
*** Interactive audio technology
**** *Interactive audio:* The sound responds in real time.
     Responds to what? Somebody's /action/.
     - People work in the physical world.
     - Computers work with information. \pause
**** The key to interaction:
     #+BEGIN_CENTER
     Physical action $\to$ data (numbers).
     #+END_CENTER

*** Devices for interaction
**** /Action $\to$ data/ requires a control device.
     - *Mouse:* Points at one thing at a time. \pause
     - *Keyboard:* On/off. No smooth changes. \pause
     - *MIDI:* Musically useful. Steers your mind towards "playing an instrument." \pause
     - *Game controllers:* Possible; not often used with computers. \pause
     - *Touchscreens:* Everybody has one! \\
       /Lemur/ is specially designed for electronic arts (but $$$!). \pause
     - *TUIO:* Tangible User Interface Objects (e.g. ReacTable). \pause
     - *Audio/video signals:* Analysis of microphone or webcam input. \pause
     - *Sensors, custom devices:* E.g. Arduino, Leap Motion.

*** This workshop: Touchscreens
**** We'll use phones and tablets in this workshop.
     Mobile control app: *TouchOSC.* \\
     Other apps: 
     - /mrmr/.
     - /Control/ (Charlie Roberts).
     - /OSC Surface/.
     - /QuickOSC/.
     Many more. Search your app store for "OSC."

** About controls
*** Buttons and faders

***** Controls divide into two categories:
      - Buttons (按钮) :: Discrete events. \\
        /When/ something should happen.
      - Faders (推子) :: Continuous levels. \\
       	E.g., pitch, volume, pan, speed, etc.

*** Buttons = triggers
**** Generally, buttons turn things on or off.
     - You need to know /what/ happened, /when/.
     - You don't need a lot of detail.
     - TouchOSC buttons are either 0 or 1.
**** MIDI keyboards.
     - A MIDI keyboard is basically an array of buttons!
     - /Note-on/ and /note-off/.
     - Note number identifies /which/ trigger.
     - Velocity is extra detail, but /doesn't change/ after note-on.

*** Normalized range *(IMPORTANT)*
**** *Solution:* \eGls{normalized} vs. actual data /ranges/.
     *Range:* The lowest and highest meaningful numbers for a control.
     - Frequency: 20--20,000 Hz
     - Volume: 0--1 (same as $-\infty$--0 dB).
     - Pan: --1 to 1.
    A \egls{normalized} range is always 0--1.
    - MIDI uses 0--127: $midi \div 127$ is normalized.
**** Physical controls and displays use /normalized/ ranges.
     They don't have to care how the number will be used.

*** Data range mapping
**** To use external information, /map/ it onto a real range.
     Relevant factors:
     - /Size/ of the range: $high - low$.
     - /Offset/: Low boundary's position, relative to 0.
**** $normData \times scale + offset$ is a common pattern.

*** Data range mapping: Panning
**** For example, panning.
     - Real range = --1 to 1.
     - Incoming \gls{normalized} range: 0 to 1.
     - The real range is twice as wide: \\
       Multiply normal range by 2 $\to$ 0 to 2.
     - The real range is shifted lower: \\
       Subtract one: 0 to 2 $\to$ --1 to 1.
#+BEGIN_CENTER
$pan = norm \times 2 - 1$
#+END_CENTER

*** Mapping curves
**** $normData \times scale + offset$ is \egls{linear} mapping.
     - *In:* Straight line 0--1.
     - *Out:* Straight line @@latex:\emph{low}--\emph{high}@@.
     - 0.1 vs. 0.2 feels the same as 0.5 vs. 0.6.
**** This is not right for every case.
     Other mapping styles:
     - \Gls{exponential} :: Useful for frequencies and durations.
     - Curved :: Uses a curve factor to "pull" the straight line toward the left or right.

*** Exponential mapping
**** Frequency is an \egls{exponential} scale.
     - An octave is always $\times 2$.
     - 100 $\to$ 200 goes up an octave.
     - 600 $\to$ 1200 goes up an octave.
     If you use linear mapping for frequency:
     - The low part of the control will produce bigger pitch changes.
     Exponential: Intervals are the same across the entire controller.
**** This also works for rhythm.
     - Short notes take less time---so you need more of them.
**** Demo.

*** Curve mapping
**** Curve: If it doesn't "feel right" to use linear or exponential.
     A \egls{curve factor} bends the line.
     - *Curve = 0:* Straight line.
     - *Curve < 0:* Pulls the line toward the left.
     - *Curve > 0:* Pulls the line toward the right.
     You can "tune" the response how you like.
**** Demo.

*** Physical data range
**** TouchOSC (and SC graphics objects) are /virtual/.
     - They exist in software.
     - Software defines the range.
     - No problem to make it exactly 0--1.
**** The range coming from physical devices may not be 0--1.
     Especially if you're measuring something in the real world.

*** Measurement and calibration
**** /Measure/ and /calibrate/ physical devices.
     *Measurement:*
     - Before doing anything else, look at the raw numbers coming in.
     - How low or high do they tend to go?
     - /Clip/ the range at a reasonable point.
     *Calibration:*
     - Measurements can change based on the environment.
     - You might need to shift the range for performance in different spaces.
**** Demo.

*** External sources: General plan
**** This is a good way to approach new controllers:
     1. /Examine/ the raw data coming in.
	- Print the numbers on screen.
	- Collect them into arrays and make graphs.
	- Look for usable ranges.
     2. /Data repair/. \\
	Only if needed: \Glspl{smoothing filter}, etc.
     3. /Map/ the data onto audio or control inputs.
	- /Normalize/ the raw data if needed.
	- Then convert to the desired range.
