| Term               | Plural    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| argument           |           | An input to a function or method, provided at the time of calling it                                                                                       |
| callback           |           | A function that executes in response to an event in some other part of the system. If you make a GUI button, a click needs to ``call back'' into your code |
| class              | classes   | An object definition, consisting of variables (for data storage) and methods (for the object's operations)                                                 |
| curve factor       |           | A number that ``bends" a linear mapping into a curve. The larger the number, the more extreme the curve                                                    |
| exponential        |           | A data range with steps defined by multiplication: an interval of $\times 1.5$ feels identical, at any level                                               |
| granular synthesis |           | A technique for generating complex sounds from short, overlapping segments of recorded audio                                                               |
| latency            | latencies | It takes time for mic input to reach SC, and also for SC's calculations to reach the speakers. This time is \emph{latency}                                 |
| linear             |           | A data range with steps defined by addition: an interval of $+0.1$ feels identical, at any level                                                           |
| method             |           | An action which an object can perform. Very similar to a function, but it belongs to a class and has a name                                                |
| normalized         |           | Describes a standard range associated with a physical control or on-screen display. Typically 0--1                                                         |
| object             |           | The focal point of object-oriented programming. Objects combine \emph{data} and \emph{actions} (``methods") into single entities.                          |
| OSC                |           | Open Sound Control. A communication protocol to send light, but structured, messages over a network                                                        |
| path               |           | A /-separated string, giving a location in a tree structure. File paths go through directories. OSC command paths use slashes the same way                 |
| scide              |           | SuperCollider Integrated Development Environment. The main code-interaction interface                                                                      |
| sclang             |           | SuperCollider language. Evaluates code and displays results                                                                                                |
| scsynth            |           | SuperCollider synthesis server. Receives OSC messages and produces audio                                                                                   |
| smoothing filter   |           | Reduces jitter in unstable signals. Common smoothing filters are \emph{moving average} and \emph{moving median}                                            |
| UGen               |           | A Unit Generator, defining a signal-processing operation that runs in the audio server                                                                     |
| control input      |           | An argument of a synthesis function. The server exposes control inputs to be set from the language client: \cd{synth.set(\textbackslash name, newValue);}  |
| variable           |           | A placeholder for an object, necessary to recall an object later and address method calls to it                                                            |
| default            |           | A value that will be used unless you specify another value. E.g., the default frequency for \cd{SinOsc.ar} is 440 Hz                                       |
| rate               |           | Of a UGen, its calculation rate: audio rate, control rate or initial rate                                                                                  |

| Pdef          |             | Global storage for pattern proxies, where the patterns produce sequencing events                                                                                   |

| Tdef          |             | Global storage for Tasks. Give the task function a name, and Tdef will treat the function as a Task                                                                |
| Function      |             | A code block, with local variables and arguments, that can be executed at any time by calling ``value'' on it. A function always returns exactly one result object |
| NodeProxy     | NodeProxies | A hot-swappable placeholder for a Synth on the server                                                                                                              |
